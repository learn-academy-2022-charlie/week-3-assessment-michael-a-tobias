# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: 
  `this` in JavaScript is a method that is used within an object to refer to itself. For example, while working in React, we would often create states as an object with key:value pairs. If we wanted to invoke the key:value pair we would first need to invoke the class using `this`, object, and key value using dot notation.

  Researched answer: 
  `this` is  keyword, not a method, that references a value within the object `this` is placed in. If `this` is used outside of an object, it will return a value of undefined.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer:
  React is a framework created by Facebook to make websites that takes user input and dynamically updates the portions of a webpage that respond to the input. That's why whenever you click a like button on Facebook it doesn't refresh the whole page. It also allows web developers to create JavaScript building blocks, called components, that can be reused in a plug-and-play style. I have seen React used to create browser games, food ordering apps, and personal websites. React is popular because of how it instantly responds to user input, and components make it easier for developers to reuse code.

  Researched answer:
  React is an open-source JavaScript library. React is so fast because it will render a virtual DOM and make any necessary changes by updating the virtual DOM. This allows website updates to render nearly instantly and avoids refreshing the whole page. React is popular because it is able to handle large amounts of components, it is well supported and documented, and there is a large community that helps with React problems.


3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer:
  Render is a lifecycle method required in a React class component because it gives the command to push the code to the website.

  Researched answer:
  A React class component lifecycle consists of three phases: mounting, updating, and unmounting. Within these phases there are several lifecycle methods. Render is the *only* required lifecycle method.
